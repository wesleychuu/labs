    <h1>My Paragraphs</h1>

    <p>
        I worked at an office in the summer, it was kind of <em>boring.</em> I did strength training for a month and lost
        10 pounds. I also ate <strong>10 chicken drumsticks</strong> in 30 minutes. I went to my buddy's place and did karaoke.
    </p>

    <p>
        I like to play arcade games at the arcade because it is fun. I spent <strong>$100</strong> on a prepaid card that I only used a 
        few times. It was a huge waste of money. I <em>hate</em> it when my life sucks because it is bad. I also hate it
        when I try to sleep longer, but end up waking up too early.
